# 1-1-4. checkpoint 1) Briefly discuss the results. How does the work done in an isothermal process compare with the work done in an adiabatic process for the same volume change?

# Comparison and Discussion

## Isothermal Process
The work done in an isothermal process (blue curve) is consistently more negative (greater magnitude) compared to the adiabatic process for the same change in volume. This is because in an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant, and heat is allowed to flow in or out of the system, requiring more energy (or work) to be done as the volume increases.

## Adiabatic Process

The work done in an adiabatic process (orange curve) is less negative compared to the isothermal process. In the adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, so the system's internal energy directly influences the work done. Since there is no heat exchange, resulting in less work being done for the same volume change.
