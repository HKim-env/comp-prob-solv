# 2-1-4. checkpoint 1) Comparing the behavior of B2V

## Comparison and Discussion
1) At low temperatures, both the square-well and Lennard-Jones potentials show strongly negative B2V, indicating attractive interactions dominate.

2) The hard-sphere potential, on the other hand, does not exhibit negative values at any temperature. Its purely repulsive nature keeps B2V positive and constant. This highlights how the absence of attraction in the potential results in no temperature dependence.

3) As temperature increases, the attractive forces in both the square-well and Lennard-Jones models become weaker relative to thermal energy, causing B2V to approach zero. The hard-sphere potential remains constant since there is no attraction to be weakened by temperature.

## Shape of the Potential and B2V Behavior
1) Repulsive-only potentials like the hard-sphere model lead to positive, constant B2V, as particles cannot approach closely enough to interact attractively.

2) Attractive-repulsive potentials, like the square-well and Lennard-Jones models, result in negative B2V at low temperatures due to clustering and condensation effects driven by attractive forces. As temperature increases, the effect of the attraction diminishes, leading to a rise in B2V towards zero, and possibly positive values when repulsion dominates
