def compute_work_isothermal(V_i, V_f, n, R, T, num_points=1000):
    """
    Computes the work done during an isothermal process for an ideal gas.
    
    Parameters:
    V_i (float): Initial volume in cubic meters.
    V_f (float): Final volume in cubic meters.
    n (float): Amount of substance in moles (mol).
    R (float): Ideal gas constant in J/mol-K.
    T (float): Temperature in Kelvin (constant for isothermal process).
    num_points (int): Number of points to use for numerical integration (default is 1000).
    
    Returns:
    float: The work done during the isothermal process in Joules.
    
    Explanation:
    The function computes the work done during an isothermal process based on the relation:
        W = - âˆ« P dV, where P = nRT / V (ideal gas law for isothermal process).
    
    The work is computed using the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration over the specified 
    volume range (V_i to V_f). The pressure at each volume is determined using the ideal gas law.
